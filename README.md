### 🛠️ How to Load Data (Side-Loading)  

To manually load or restore previous data into the A11y app, follow these steps:  

1. **Close the A11y App:**  
   - **Ensure the app is completely closed before proceeding.** Keeping the app open during this process may cause data corruption or errors.  

2. **Navigate to the App Directory:**  
   - On your Android device, open a file manager and go to:  
     **`Android > data > com.tanujn45.a11y > Documents`**  

3. **Replace Files and Folders:**  
   - Delete the existing contents in the `Documents` folder.  
   - Copy and paste your backed-up files and folders into the `Documents` directory.  

4. **Restart the App:**  
   - Open the A11y app to view the side-loaded data, including raw videos, trimmed data, models, and gesture instances.  

⚠️ **Note:** Ensure the app remains closed during the entire transfer process to avoid issues.
